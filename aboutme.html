<h2>About me</h2>
<h1>All about Kawtar!üíã</h1>

<h3>Biography</h3>
<p>	I was born in Casablanca, Morocco but I mainly grew up in Brooklyn and Queens, New York. I moved to New Jersey at age 5 then at age 7 I moved to New York.Growing up I've always had a huge interest in Law enforcement and criminal justice. I do wish to major in that field but I also have a interest in the medical field. Both majors would be really exciting to invest my time in but college will help me minimize these 2 majors to one. So far I've done one internship the summer of my junior year going to my senior year. The intership focused on law and csi and it was a great experience for someone who has a interest in that field.</p>

<p>	Being born in another country always was important to me because it changes your lifestyle a lot. American culture and Moroccan culture are very different. A few of my hobbies are watching netflix series and sleeping. Getting a good amount of hours every night is very crucial for a busy girl like me. Also working has recently became a major part of my daily routine. It's also considered a hobby. I've never had any pets due to my fear of every animal that exists. I have 3 siblings, 2 little brothers and a older sister. Without my siblings I would have a hard time coping with a lot of things. Siblings in general make things better sometimes. I have moved 4 times in the course of my life. I've only lived in the boroughs Brooklyn and Queens but I prefer Astoria, Queens much much better than East Williamsburg, Broolyn because Astoria is where most of my family is and it just feels more like home. Most of the people in Astoria are Arab like me so it makes me more comfortable. 

<h4>Technology</h4>
<p>	Technology is an everyday use in everyones daily lives. One main technology that is very crucial to me is my phone. I go everywhere with my phone and although I don't always have it in my hand it's just something I always have to have on me. My laptop and tv are also two things that I don't use very often but they are techoloogies that are part of my life. I would say I use my tv on a daily basis. However as myself and many others would say my phone is one technology that I use on a daily basis.
